    <h4><i><u><b>Description</b></u></i></h4>
    <p>Turtles are unique reptiles known for their protective shell, which consists of an upper part called the carapace and a lower part known as the plastron. Their bodies are broad and flattened for efficient swimming, with aquatic turtles featuring webbed feet or flippers, while land turtles have sturdy, clawed legs. Turtles have small heads with beak-like mouths and eyes on the sides for a wide field of vision. With their diverse colors and patterns, turtles embody ancient resilience and a variety of adaptations to their environments.</p>
